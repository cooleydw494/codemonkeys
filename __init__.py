__description__ = "CodeMonkeys is a highly configurable tool for creating/running strategic AI automations (and " \
                  "more). Beyond that, its a thoughtful and extensible framework for creating automations. " \
                  "CodeMonkeys' design was heavily influenced by how much it was used in its own development, " \
                  "naturally converging to a sublime synergy of the tool and the codemonkeys files."
