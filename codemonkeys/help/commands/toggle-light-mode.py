Here is a Python script that prints a useful summary and usage instructions for your `toggleLightMode` command:

from codemonkeys.defs import nl
from codemonkeys.utils.monk.theme_functions import print_t

# Title
print_t(f"Toggle Light Mode Help{nl}", "important")

# Brief description of the command
print_t(f"The `toggle-light-mode` command switches between Light and Dark modes in a project's theme configuration. "
        f"This is useful for developers who want to quickly switch between their preferred coding environments without "
        f"manually editing the configuration file.{nl}")

# Usage instruction
print_t(f"Usage: `monk toggle-light-mode`{nl}", "info")

# Output details
print_t("On execution, the command reads the theme configuration file, determines if Light Mode is currently enabled, "
        "and then toggles between the states. For instance, if Light Mode is on, the command will turn it off and vice versa.{nl}")

# Usage example
print_t("EXAMPLE:", "info")
print_t("> `monk toggle-light-mode`")
print_t("Disabling Light Mode...")

print()
print_t("And if you run this command again when the Light Mode is off...", "warning")
print_t("> `monk toggle-light-mode`")
print_t("Enabling Light Mode...{nl}")

# Caution
print_t("Tip: Use this command anytime during the project lifecycle to toggle between Light and Dark modes. But always make "
        "sure your project files are saved as these changes will affect your theme configuration, and unsaved changes might be lost.", "warning")
